This project was planned and built by a team of four from the grounds, using the Spring Framework and Postgres for persistence.
It's intended to serve as a rent site for items or services, uploaded by the users.
The front end is using AJAX do dynamically filter results, as we tried to make the user's browse experience as seamless as possible.
The quality of the items or opinion on the users can also be submitted through reviews, not unlike many similarly built professional sites on the internet.
